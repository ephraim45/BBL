            <p>Over the past 100 years, alot of areas in life have been <br> revolutionized but education is not one of them. Historically, higher <br> education has avoided competitive disruption. One reason for this <br> past immunity is the power of prestige in the higher education <br> marketplace, where the quality of the product is hard to measure. <br> At Ubunifu Our focus is to graduate all students innovation ready, <br> ready to solve problems creatively</p>
